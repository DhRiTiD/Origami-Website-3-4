                <p>Cicadas, very unique insects that enter our lawn and   make shrieking, buzzing sounds during a hot summer  day.
                      Did you know, they improve lawns by digging tunnels that   allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies   put nitrogen into the soil.
                      Well, if you want a buzzzzing bug in your lawn, you sure  must try folding a piece of paper into a little cicada  for your lawn.

                     self recognition.
